<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>This project is originally from CS 161, Computer Security, and it applied the cryptographic primitives to design and implemented the client application for a secure file
    sharing system via Golang. To implemented each functions of the system, we needed to design a data structure to store RSA keys, encryption keys and the hashcode of username
    for each user program and then applied a couple of strategy to make sure the confidentiality, integrity and authenticity of file sharing. The system's functions included: 
    Authenticate with a username and password; Save files to the server; Load saved files from the server; Overwrite saved files on the server; Append to saved files on the 
    server; Share saved files with other users; and Revoke access to previously shared files.
